There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.

  Art by Humans

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.

  This product is for everyone who loves art and hates machines who make art.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

  The world of art is entering a new period of radical transformation. The age of the machine Michelangelo is on the horizon. AI art made machine learning models by DALL-E, Midjourney, and others have reached such fidelity and sophistication that art made by humans feels woefully antiquated and at risk of extinction. Maybe you turn to google images and think, I just want to see some human art, but your queries are polluted with the latest cursed images from Midjourney. We can offer you refuge from the machine storm. We can offer you art by humans. Powered by Blockchain technology (pending) with support for NFTs in the future.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.

  Google search often gives results of questionable quality when it comes to looking at art and with the rise of AI art, this problem only gets worse. Am I looking at a true digital copy of the Mona Lisa? Or is it nothing more than

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

  We offer a curated, high quality, searchable database of art made exclusively by humans.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.

  "Everyone is talking about DALL-E, but what about Dali?" - John Berger, Chief Art Officer and author of "Ways of Seeing"

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.

  Simply type the artist, title, or topic of a particular work and you will see a gallery of beautiful results.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.

  "Finally, a place where I can view true art made by humans without risking exposure to machine propaganda" - Morpheus

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.

  Human artistic expression through drawing and painting is a fundamental part of our species and up until now has been unique in the known universe. The machines threaten this core element of humanity and this application may be the last best hope for our future. You, dear reader, must now go to SF MOMA, or the Louvre, or whatever local human-based art museum near you to keep the dream of human art alive. If those aren't available near you, convientetly go to artbyhumans.com.
